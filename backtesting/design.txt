Backtesting

A datasource will spew stock info at the server. The server must be able to keep up with the rate of data.
The data will contain the current mark price of stocks in the stockList.
The point of backtesting is to determine the efficacy of a Strategy.
The Accountant will keep track of all the Strategy's performances and print a summary for each at the end.
The Strategies have one or more Portfolios for the Accountant
A Strategy can produce Trades; a Trade is a buy or sell order, market or limit. (TODO: implement stops)
(TODO: Trades can cost Fees. These fees are based on the number of shares and also the total value)
